# Steeply

 Steeply is a react native app in collaboration with Rebecca Cundiff's Occupational Therapy Doctorate project with the purpose of assiting pediatric oncology with resources on going through a cancer diagnosis. 

The core idea of the app is to utilize instagram/snapchat stories formatting to present informational graphics that kids with a new cancer diagnosis can digest in a less overwhelming format compared with the binders of pamphlets usually given in hospitals.
